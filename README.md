## Experimented features
 - Functional tests with Robot pattern
 - Support-vector-drawables
 - Feature based package structure with MVP
 - Dagger injector pattern

## Setting up the project
 - Ensure both JDK 7 and 8 are installed on your system
 - Open in Android Studio and make sure JDK 8 is set in module settings

## Checking Java versions on OSX
 - Run `$ /usr/libexec/java_home -V` from the terminal.
 - The output should be similar to this:

 ```
     1.8.0_77, x86_64:	"Java SE 8"	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_77.jdk/Contents/Home
     1.7.0_80, x86_64:	"Java SE 7"	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_80.jdk/Contents/Home
 ```
 - Running `$ java -version` should output: `java version "1.8.0_77"` (or later)
 - If JDK 8 is not available, download from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
